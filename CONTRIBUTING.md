# Grim Engine Contributing

## Introduction

This project is open source, but it's also intended to be a learning tool for me to start with. In the initial versions, I will very much invite/welcome feedback and approaches that would improve the codebase.

To begin with, I probably won't be looking for too many PR's though, as I work my way through an end-to-end working implementation.

## How to Contribute
