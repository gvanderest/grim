//! Object placement: the [`Object`] marker and the [`CarriedBy`] carrier link.
//!
//! An object is on the ground while it carries the actor layer's `InRoom` and
//! carried while it carries [`CarriedBy`] — the get/drop handlers swap the two
//! atomically, so no tick ever sees both (a room listing would show it) or
//! neither (it would vanish).

/// drop matching), `RoomDescription` (long line under the room description),
/// and optionally `Description` (`look <target>` paragraphs).
