//! World subsystem: the static spatial structure of the game — rooms, areas,
//! exits, and the shared room-address lookups over them — plus the graceful
//! server-shutdown signal/countdown machinery (`ShutdownPlugin`).
//!
//! This crate is **being-free**: it knows the rooms, not who stands in them.
//! The beings (`Character`, `Player`, `InRoom`, …) and the verbs that read them
//! (`look`, `move`, `goto`, `quit`, `title`, and the admin `shutdown` gate) live
//! in `grim-actor`, which depends on this crate — never the reverse.
