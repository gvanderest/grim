//! The player-character being ([`Character`]) and the [`Role`] privileges it can

//!
//! A `Character` is the **PC-only** half of a being: it belongs to an account and
//! carries the persistent player state that a creature has no use for (account,
//! roles, class, title, restrings, last room). The shared "alive thing" fields
//! (race, level, gender) live on [`Actor`](crate::Actor), and the display name
//! lives on the `Name` component (`grim_core::components::Name`) — a
//! `Character` no longer stores a `name`.
//!
//! `Character` is not itself serialized: its on-disk form is the flat
//! [`StoredCharacter`](crate::StoredCharacter) DTO, which is the only disk
//! surface and preserves the pre-split JSON layout.
