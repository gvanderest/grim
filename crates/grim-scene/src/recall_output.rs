//! Recall echoes: per-recipient room broadcasts for a [`RecallEvent`].
//!
//! A separate system from [`crate::output::format_output`] because that one
//! is already at Bevy's system-parameter ceiling (see
//! [`crate::output::format_server_broadcast`]. The room left sees the
//! attempt, then the disappearance; the room entered sees a recall-marked
//! arrival. The recaller is excluded everywhere — they get the arrival
//! description instead.
