//! System-parameter bundles for the pre-game flow.
//!
//! Bevy caps a system at 16 parameters. The login/creation dispatcher and the
//! world-entry placement need more resources/queries than that, so cohesive
//! groups are bundled into `#[derive(SystemParam)]` structs here.
//!
//! These are grim-auth's OWN params over the underlying components/resources —
//! deliberately NOT grim-scene's param structs (coupling to scene's internal
//! `SystemParam`s is avoided; only genuinely shared domain helpers like
//! `grim_scene::formatter` are called across the crate boundary).
